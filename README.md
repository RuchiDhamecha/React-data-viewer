# React-data-viewer-app

### Built a React.js application that:
- have login form
- home page having users data displayed on

### Tools & Technologies I used
- zod - for validating login form
- axios - for making HTTP requests from a web browser
- react-hook-form - to manage form state efficiently
- TypeScript - for foe type safety
- SCSS - for better modular styling
- react-router-dom - to navigate from login page to homepage

### Public API used-
